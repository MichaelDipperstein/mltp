MLTP: a Two-Level Thread Library for SMP Linux Machines

Abstract

This thesis is focused on the design and implementation of an
open-source two-level thread package called MLTP for the Linux
operating system running on Intel PC SMPs.  Kernel threads
directly scheduled by multiprocessor OS normally have high
context switch cost compared to user-level threads.  User-level
threads scheduled within a single kernel process are not capable of
utilizing multiple processors.  Many parallel applications running 
on SMPs require support for flexible control of kernel and user-level
threads and  such a package is not available on the Linux operating
system.  In the thesis talk, I will discuss an M-to-N architecture
for MLTP and a design for efficient synchronization and switch among
threads.  Such a design allows a multi-thread application to achieve
scalability and efficiency in multi-processor environments at a low
cost.  I will also present performance of MLTP for several
micro-benchmarks and applications on Intel Xeon dual and quad-processor
SMPs.
