MLTP: a Two-Level Thread Library for SMP Linux Machines

This project is focused on the design and implementation of an open-source
two-level thread package called MLTP for the Linux version 2.0 operating system
running on 32-bit Intel SMP PCs.

It was my Masters thesis project that I worked on between 1999 and 2000.  It ran
on what used to be a pretty impressive Linux cluster and worked around a few
problems that the old kernels had on SMP architectures.
