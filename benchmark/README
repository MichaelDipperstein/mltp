The files included in these subdirectories are the files used to
benchmark the Multi-Layer Thread Package (mltp) for SMP Linux.

Each of the leaf directories includes a Makefile for the files that
they contain.  The paths at the top of each Makefile need to be
edited to match the paths to the thread packages on the machine
performing the compilation.

Good Luck,
